# About ARIES
ARIES, the Aggregation of Restaurants for Insatiable Employees of SGA, keeps tabs on favorite restaurants within the general vicinity of Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. Here you can easily find links to check out of order from almost any local restaurant you can think of. The site was developed and maintained by Kaden Lyttle and Liam Creek, two junior developers at SGA.

# About reaction-ARIES
As my fellow junior dev, Liam, has been stuck in the phase of learning Bootstrap, I have taken up the mantle of shoving React into ARIES so the HTML code to render the entire list of restaurant data can stop being over 2,000 lines where you have to edit everything individually.
